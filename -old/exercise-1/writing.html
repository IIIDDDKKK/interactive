    <h1>JASPER JOHNS<br>& ISRAEL LUND</h1>
        <p>When we dream, who and what do we dream for? When Jasper Johns dreamt of a flag, was he dreaming of a thing? Or was he dreaming of a nation? Was he dreaming for himself or for the country? We are told that we dream alone. That dreams tell us the things about ourselves that we could never admit in the light of day. We are told that dreams are symptoms of individuality. It’s all a sign of a creeping power annexing the last frontier of free time. But there’s more there than an I.</p>
        <p>The power of <em>Flag</em>, Johns’ painting of 1954, lies in the path it traces between a dream, a thing, and its representation. But its meaning hinges on these elements being held apart, it depends on dreams being “unreal,” on images being shades of what they represent. The flag as a thing helps us fit that piece called nationalism into the larger puzzle of our identity. The individual, the flag, the nation—Like Johns’ painting, the flag itself unites the first and last elements while also holding them apart. The flag is useful less as a symbol of a nation and more as a tool deployed by power in the constitution of a multitude of individuals, separate from each other but bound together by force. Recognition of the flag, of oneself in the flag, and of the power it wields, is recognition of isolation. Red goes here, blue goes here; here’s a star and here’s a star and here’s a star. Everything in its place. Everyone in their place.</p>
        <p>Israel Lund’s painting was never meant to be a flag. But everyone who has seen it says that it is. It hangs upside down, a distorted reflection of the Stars and Stripes in a pool of water; you can see it, but you can also see through it. Lund’s flag looks a bit more like that of an accidental nation. The dream, the thing, the representation—Lund’s flag bypasses the middle category and seesaws between imitation and speculation. It looks like the country we inherited but also like the country we could have. It resembles a flag but questions the integrity of such a symbol. There are imitations of geometric authority but everything falls together in a collage of images of ambiguous origin and association, related concretely only in being timely with each other. We’re here together, they say, let’s make something of it. So if Jasper Johns dreamt his flag then who dreamt Lund’s? Maybe if we dream together we’ll find out.</p>
